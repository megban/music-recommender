## Data scraping

The directory `spotify-scraper` contains code to download song data from Spotify
in addition to spectrogram conversion. See the readme for the directory for more
information.

## Models

Install packages in `requirements.txt`.

Most models are self contained in each `.py` file. If you are interested in
running the CNN, please reach out for the dataset, which is multiple gigabytes
of images (too large for this repository).
